h1. MongoDB for Joomla!

These drivers are specifically written for using MongoDB with Joomla!, most specifically the following subsystems:

* JCache
* JSession

The drivers are currently embedded for Joomla! 1.5 as part of the "sml4joomla":https://github.com/spacemonkey/sml4joomla project, and are being ported to the Joomla! 3.0 release here.

Stay tuned!
